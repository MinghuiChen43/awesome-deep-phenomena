# Awesome Deep Phenomena [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
Our understanding of modern neural networks lags behind their practical successes. This growing gap poses a challenge to the pace of progress in machine learning because fewer pillars of knowledge are available to designers of models and algorithms. Inspired by the [ICML 2019 workshop Identifying and Understanding Deep Learning Phenomena](http://deep-phenomena.org/), I collect papers which present interesting empirical study or insight into the nature of deep learning.

## Deep Learning Theory


## Empirical Study

#### 2019
- Deep Double Descent: Where Bigger Models and More Data Hurt.
  [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02292)  
  - Preetum Nakkiran, Gal Kaplun, Yamini Bansal, Tristan Yang, Boaz Barak, Ilya Sutskever. *ICLR 2020*
  - Digest: We show that a variety of modern deep learning tasks exhibit a "double-descent" phenomenon where, as we increase model size, performance first gets worse and then gets better.

- Are All Layers Created Equal?
  [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01996)  
  - Chiyuan Zhang, Samy Bengio, Yoram Singer. *ICML 2019 Workshop*
  - Digest: We show that the layers can be categorized as either "ambient" or "critical". Resetting the ambient layers to their initial values has no negative consequence, and in many cases they barely change throughout training. On the contrary, resetting the critical layers completely destroys the predictor and the performance drops to chanceh.
