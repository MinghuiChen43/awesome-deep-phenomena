Our understanding of modern neural networks lags behind their practical successes. This growing gap poses a challenge to the pace of progress in machine learning because fewer pillars of knowledge are available to designers of models and algorithms. Inspired by the [ICML 2019 workshop Identifying and Understanding Deep Learning Phenomena](http://deep-phenomena.org/), I collect papers which present interesting empirical study or insight into the nature of deep learning.
