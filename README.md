# Awesome Deep Phenomena [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
Our understanding of modern neural networks lags behind their practical successes. This growing gap poses a challenge to the pace of progress in machine learning because fewer pillars of knowledge are available to designers of models and algorithms. Inspired by the [ICML 2019 workshop Identifying and Understanding Deep Learning Phenomena](http://deep-phenomena.org/), I collect papers which present interesting empirical study or insight into the nature of deep learning.
